- 👋 Hi, I’m @su-type
- 👀 I’m interested in Leverage open-source, convenient tools for research in neuroscience. As most people know, a lot of people doing basic neuroscience or biomedical research don't know how to use programming to make their jobs faster, and I'm in a dilemma right now. So I'm learning how to take advantage of the GitHub platform and find the right tools
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to use some of the great open source tools on this platform
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on right tools
